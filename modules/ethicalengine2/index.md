## Scenario: Robotoni's Disaster-Relief Robot
You are working for an emerging robotics company, _Robotoni_, that is taking the admiral stance of developing robots to aid in life-threatening events. Their current objective is to build a fleet of autonomous robots that will rescue people in who are caught in two natural disasters: wildfires and floods.

_Robotoni_ has already built a robot that can navigate unknown terrain and successfully rescue people who are in need of help. However, for _Robotoni_ robots to act autonomously and maximize their impact, they must also make hard decisions. In effect, the _Robotoni_ robot must **prioritize who to save**.

Your job is to write a comparison algorithm for the _Robotoni Disaster-Relief Robot_ in which it compares two groups of people and decides which group to prioritize for relief.
