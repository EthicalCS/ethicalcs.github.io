## Scenario: Moogle's Hiring Filter
Imagine you are working for _Moogle_, a well-known tech company that receives tens of thousands of job applications from graduating seniors every year.

Since the company receives too many job applications for HR to individually assess in a reasonable amount of time, you are asked to create a program that algorithmically analyzes applications and selects the ones most worth passing onto HR.

## Assignment
Students are presented _Part 1_ without **any** ethical framing or knowledge of _Part 2_.
