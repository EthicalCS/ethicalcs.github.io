## Scenario: Teluta's Autonomous Cars
_Teluta_ - an autonomous vehicle company - has made extraordinary strides in self-driving cars and is ready to go to market. But there is a corner case that needs to be addressed. In the rare instances in which _Teluta_ vehicles can sense an impending crash, they need a mechanism to quickly assess and value human life. That is, the car must rapidly _choose who to save_.

Your job is to create the code for _Teluta_ that models a person.

### Familiarize yourself with the Moral Machine
Visit MIT's [Moral Machine](http://moralmachine.mit.edu/). From their website:

> From self-driving cars on public roads to self-piloting reusable rockets landing on self-sailing ships, machine intelligence is supporting or entirely taking over ever more complex human activities at an ever increasing pace. The greater autonomy given machine intelligence in these roles can result in situations where they have to make autonomous choices involving human life and limb. This calls for not just a clearer understanding of how humans make such choices, but also a clearer understanding of how humans perceive machine intelligence making such choices.

Briefly, the _Moral Machine_ is an online simulator that lets you experiment with the kinds of scenarios that _Teluta_ outlined above.
