# Ethical Reflection Modules for CS 1

In Fall 2019, I redesigned our CS 1 course to integrate practice-based (coding!) reflection directly with technical concepts. This space acts as a repository of ethical reflection modules that I have created over the past couple of years. The goal of these modules is to:
1. Introduce ethical reflection in CS 1 courses. These are categorized based on [Amy Ko's 21st Century Grand Challenges in Computing Education](https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/21st-grand-challenges-for-computing-education-f5e937d57155) - _limits of computing_, _social responsibility_, _data literacy_, and _diversity literacy_
2. Develop ethical reflection habits _alongside_ coding (all modules involve programming!)
3. Pair directly with _existing_ CS 1 curriculum (students practice for loops - but instead of practicing on trivial problems, their practice is situated in ethical design scenarios)

What these activies are **not**: 
 
- They do **not** teach students what the _right_ or _best_ design is. They  prompt students to reflect on the human consequences of their decisions.
- They are **not** a replacement for teaching students cultural competency

## **[Conditionals]** Developers as Decision-Makers
![housing algorithms](img/housing.png)

- Scenario: Develop a scoring algorithm to determine which classmates are prioritized for housing on campus. 
- Material: [Nifty Assignments 2019 Page](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2020/peck-decision-makers/)
- Context: 2 hour lab setting. Small student groups. 
- This assignment appeared as part of [_ACM SIGCSE'S Nifty Assignments_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3328778.3372574) track. You can cite that work with:

## **[Functions & Data-types]** Developers as Gatekeepers
![input validation](img/university.jpg)
_What assumptions do we make about the people using our technology? What are the consequences of those assumptions? - who might we exclude? How do we capture diversity through design?_

--------------------

## **[For Loops & Lists]** Developers as Future Makers
![ethical hiring](img/hiring.jpg)
_What does it mean to design a fair algorithm? What is the human cost of efficiency? What systemic advantages/disadvantages are your algorithms likely to amplify?_
- *Scenario:* Develop an algorithm that filters job applications based on student grades
- *Degree of Integration:* Full assignment
- *Needs improvement:* Need to update associated reading assignments and reflection prompts. 


--------------------

## **[Nested Loops & 2D Lists]** Developers as Media Manipulators
![averaging faces](img/faces.png)
- *Scenario:* Given a series of face images, write code to generate the _average_ face of those images.





------------------------
## **[Intro OOP]** Developers as Moral Arbiters
![rescue](modules/ethicalengine1/img/people.jpg)
_What is 'moral' behavior in the context of a computer? How do we write code that is forced to assign value to people? What are the implications of our representation decisions?_
- *Scenario:* Program a disaster-relief robot to prioritize which distressed people to saves
