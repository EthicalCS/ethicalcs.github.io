# Ethical Reflection Modules for CS 1

Over the past two years or so, I have developed a handful of ethical reflection modules for CS 1 courses. The goal of these modules is to:
1. Introduce ethical reflection in CS 1 courses
2. Develop ethical reflection habits _alongside_ coding (all modules involve programming!)
3. Pair directly with _existing_ CS 1 curriculum (students practice for loops - but instead of practicing on trivial problems, their practice is situated in ethical design scenarios)

By reducing the barrier to adoption, my hope is that ethical reflection can be implemented more broadly in CS curriculum as a critical habit.

## [Hiring Algorithms (CS 1): Computers as Decision-Makers](modules/hiring)

![ethical hiring](img/hiring.jpg)

_What does it mean to design a fair algorithm? What is the human cost of efficiency? What systemic advantages/disadvantages are your algorithms likely to amplify?_
- [Material](modules/hiring)
- *Practice:* `for` loops, conditionals, `lists`
- *Writeup:* [Ethical Design in CS 1: Building Hiring Algorithms in 1 Hour (Evan Peck)](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/ethical-design-in-cs-1-building-hiring-algorithms-in-1-hour-41d8c913859f)
- *Author:* [Evan Peck (Bucknell University)](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/)

--------------------
## [Input Validation (CS 1): Diversity and Identity](modules/input)
![university](img/university.jpg)

_What assumptions do we make about the people using our technology? What are the consequences of those assumptions? - who might we exclude? How do we capture diversity through design?_
- [Material](modules/input)
- *Practice:* conditionals, functions, data types
- *Author:* [Justin Li (Occidental College)](https://justinnhli.com/), Adapted by [Evan Peck (Bucknell University)](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/)

<!-- ## [Ethical Engine 1 (CS1/2): Representation](modules/ethicalengine1)
![university](img/people.jpg)
_How should we represent people in code? What are the implications of the representations we choose? How does our code reflect our values?_

## _Coming Soon..._
Modules on _privacy, representation, decision-making_

<!-- ### Ethical Engine
- *Materials:* [Github repository](https://github.com/evanpeck/ethical_engine)
- *Practice:* Object-Oriented Programming and Design
- *Scenario:* [MIT's Moral Machine](http://moralmachine.mit.edu/) - the trolley problem resituated in the context of autonomous vehicles.
- *Ethical Questions:*
  - How do we represent people in OOP? What are the implications of representing physical features (like body weight) in code?
  - How do we write code that is forced to assign value to people (in this case, decide who the car kills and who it saves)? What is an 'ethical' design here?
  - How can we probe and audit existing code to understand its biases?
