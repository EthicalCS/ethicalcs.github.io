# Ethical Reflection Modules for CS 1

Over the past two years or so, I have developed a handful of ethical reflection modules for CS 1 courses. The goal of these modules is to:
1. Introduce ethical reflection in CS 1 courses
2. Develop ethical reflection habits _alongside_ coding (all modules involve programming!)
3. Pair directly with _existing_ CS 1 curriculum (students practice for loops - but instead of practicing on trivial problems, their practice is situated in ethical design scenarios)

By reducing the barrier to adoption, my hope is that ethical reflection can be implemented more broadly in CS curriculum as a critical habit.

## [Hiring Algorithms (CS 1): Computers as Decision-Makers](modules/hiring)

![ethical hiring](modules/hiring/img/hiring.jpg)

_What does it mean to design a fair algorithm? What is the human cost of efficiency? What systemic advantages/disadvantages are your algorithms likely to amplify?_
- *Scenario:* Develop an algorithm that filters job applications based on GPA
- [Material](modules/hiring)
- *Practice:* `for` loops, conditionals, `lists`
- *Writeup:* [Ethical Design in CS 1: Building Hiring Algorithms in 1 Hour (Evan Peck)](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/ethical-design-in-cs-1-building-hiring-algorithms-in-1-hour-41d8c913859f)
- *Author:* [Evan Peck (Bucknell University)](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/)

## [Input Validation (CS 1): Computers as Definers of Identity](modules/input)
![university](modules/input/img/university.jpg)

_What assumptions do we make about the people using our technology? What are the consequences of those assumptions? - who might we exclude? How do we capture diversity through design?_
- *Scenario:* Collect and validate personal information of people visiting a university
- [Material](modules/input)
- *Practice:* conditionals, functions, data types
- *Author:* [Justin Li (Occidental College)](https://justinnhli.com/), Adapted by [Evan Peck (Bucknell University)](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/)

<!-- ## [Ethical Engine 2 (CS1/2): Computers as Moral Arbiters](modules/ethicalengine2)
![rescue](modules/ethicalengine2/img/rescue.jpg)

_What is 'moral' behavior in the context of a computer? How do we write code that is forced to assign value to people?_
- *Scenario:* Program a disaster-relief robot to prioritize which distressed people to saves
- [Material](modules/ethicalengine2)
- *Practice:* conditionals, use of APIs and objects
- *Write ups:*

## _Coming Soon..._
Modules on _privacy, representation, decision-making_

<!-- ### Ethical Engine
- *Materials:* [Github repository](https://github.com/evanpeck/ethical_engine)
- *Practice:* Object-Oriented Programming and Design
- *Scenario:* [MIT's Moral Machine](http://moralmachine.mit.edu/) - the trolley problem resituated in the context of autonomous vehicles.
- *Ethical Questions:*
  - How do we represent people in OOP? What are the implications of representing physical features (like body weight) in code?
  - How do we write code that is forced to assign value to people (in this case, decide who the car kills and who it saves)? What is an 'ethical' design here?
  - How can we probe and audit existing code to understand its biases?
