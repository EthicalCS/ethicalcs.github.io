# Ethical Reflection Modules for CS 1

Coming soon...

### Resources
- [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)
- [Ethics in Technology Practice](https://www.scu.edu/ethics-in-technology-practice/)

## CS 1 Ethical Reflection Modules
The goal of these modules is to (1) introduce code-based ethical decisions that students must make, and (2) to pair directly with existing curriculum in CS 1 to integrate more seamlessly with existing courses.

### Ethical Engine
- *Materials:* [Github repository](https://github.com/evanpeck/ethical_engine)
- *Practice:* Object-Oriented Programming and Design
- *Scenario:* [MIT's Moral Machine](http://moralmachine.mit.edu/) - the trolley problem resituated in the context of autonomous vehicles.
- *Ethical Questions:*
  - How do we represent people in OOP? What are the implications of representing physical features (like body weight) in code?
  - How do we write code that is forced to assign value to people (in this case, decide who the car kills and who it saves)? What is an 'ethical' design here?
  - How can we probe and audit existing code to understand its biases?
- *Write ups:*
  - Evan Peck (Bucknell University): [The Ethical Engine: Integrating Ethical Design into Intro Computer Science](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/ethical-design-in-cs-1-building-hiring-algorithms-in-1-hour-41d8c913859f)
