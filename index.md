# Ethical Reflection Modules for CS 1

While standalone ethics courses are increasingly common in computer science, I found that there are a lack of resources for integrating practice-based (coding!) reflection directly into CS 1 or 2 courses. This space acts as a repository of ethical reflection modules that I have created over the past couple of years. The goal of these modules is to:
1. Introduce ethical reflection in CS 1 courses
2. Develop ethical reflection habits _alongside_ coding (all modules involve programming!)
3. Pair directly with _existing_ CS 1 curriculum (students practice for loops - but instead of practicing on trivial problems, their practice is situated in ethical design scenarios)

By reducing the barrier to adoption, my hope is that ethical reflection can be implemented more broadly in CS curriculum as a critical habit. Please read the [FAQ](docs/faq.html) for more information.

## [Hiring Algorithms: Computers as Decision-Makers](modules/hiring)

![ethical hiring](modules/hiring/img/hiring.jpg)

_What does it mean to design a fair algorithm? What is the human cost of efficiency? What systemic advantages/disadvantages are your algorithms likely to amplify?_
- *Scenario:* Develop an algorithm that filters job applications based on GPA
- [Material](modules/hiring)
- *Practice:* loops, conditionals, python lists

## [Input Validation: Computers as Gatekeepers](modules/input)
![university](modules/input/img/university.jpg)

_What assumptions do we make about the people using our technology? What are the consequences of those assumptions? - who might we exclude? How do we capture diversity through design?_
- *Scenario:* Collect and validate personal information of people visiting a university
- [Material](modules/input)
- *Practice:* conditionals, functions, data types

## [Ethical Engine 1: Computers as Definers of Identity](modules/ethicalengine1)
![rescue](modules/ethicalengine1/img/people.jpg)

_How can we adequately represent people in code? What characteristics of people should we **NOT** include in code? What are the implications of our representation decisions?_

- *Scenario:* In code, represent a person so that autonomous cars can make life-critical decisions
- [Material](modules/ethicalengine1)
- *Practice:* OOP design, data types
- *Author:* [Evan Peck (Bucknell University)](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/)

## [Ethical Engine 2: Computers as Moral Arbiters](modules/ethicalengine2)
![rescue](modules/ethicalengine2/img/rescue.jpg)

_What is 'moral' behavior in the context of a computer? How do we write code that is forced to assign value to people?_
- *Scenario:* Program a disaster-relief robot to prioritize which distressed people to saves
- [Material](modules/ethicalengine2)
- *Practice:* conditionals, use of APIs and objects, dictionaries (in optional last part)
- *Write ups:*
