## [Hiring Algorithms: Developers as Decision-Makers](modules/hiring)

![ethical hiring](modules/hiring/img/hiring.jpg)

_What does it mean to design a fair algorithm? What is the human cost of efficiency? What systemic advantages/disadvantages are your algorithms likely to amplify?_
- *Scenario:* Develop an algorithm that filters job applications based on GPA
- [Material](modules/hiring)
- *Practice:* loops, conditionals, python lists
- *Writeup:* [Ethical Design in CS 1: Building Hiring Algorithms in 1 Hour (Evan Peck)](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/ethical-design-in-cs-1-building-hiring-algorithms-in-1-hour-41d8c913859f)
- *Author:* [Evan Peck (Bucknell University)](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/)

## [Input Validation: Developers as Gatekeepers](modules/input)
![university](modules/input/img/university.jpg)

_What assumptions do we make about the people using our technology? What are the consequences of those assumptions? - who might we exclude? How do we capture diversity through design?_
- *Scenario:* Collect and validate personal information of people visiting a university
- [Material](modules/input)
- *Practice:* conditionals, functions, data types
- *Author:* [Justin Li (Occidental College)](https://justinnhli.com/), Adapted by [Evan Peck (Bucknell University)](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/)

## [Ethical Engine 1: Developers as Definers of Identity](modules/ethicalengine1)
![rescue](modules/ethicalengine1/img/people.jpg)

_How can we adequately represent people in code? What characteristics of people should we **NOT** include in code? What are the implications of our representation decisions?_

- *Scenario:* In code, represent a person so that autonomous cars can make life-critical decisions
- [Material](modules/ethicalengine1)
- *Practice:* OOP design, data types
- *Author:* [Evan Peck (Bucknell University)](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/)

--------------------
## [Ethical Engine 2: Developers as Moral Arbiters](modules/ethicalengine2)
![rescue](modules/ethicalengine2/img/rescue.jpg)

_What is 'moral' behavior in the context of a computer? How do we write code that is forced to assign value to people?_
- *Scenario:* Program a disaster-relief robot to prioritize which distressed people to saves
- [Material](modules/ethicalengine2)
- *Practice:* conditionals, use of APIs and objects, dictionaries (in optional last part)
- *Write ups:*
