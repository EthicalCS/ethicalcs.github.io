  <h1 id="ethical-reflection-modules-for-cs-1">Ethical Reflection Modules for CS 1</h1>

<p>In Fall 2019, I redesigned our CS 1 course to integrate practice-based (coding!) reflection directly with technical concepts. This is a space to share those modules. My goals for these activities are to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Introduce <strong>a deeper level of reflection in CS 1 courses</strong>. I want students to see that their actions either directly or indirectly impact people, communities, and cultures, and that this impact is often not felt equally by different groups of people (along lines of gender, race, class, geography, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Develop reflection habits <em>alongside</em> coding habits</strong> - all modules involve programming!</li>
  <li><strong>Pair directly with <em>existing</em> CS 1 curriculum</strong> - students practice <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> loops - but instead of practicing on trivial problems, their practice is situated in ethical design scenarios</li>
</ol>

<p>What these activies are <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are <strong>not</strong> a replacement for teaching students issues of cultural competency and identity. While computer scientists can (and should) point to those issues in class, we are <em>not</em> the experts. Students should be taking courses that directly speak to the structures of power that they will be introducing systems to (including gender/race/ethnicity/class/geography/etc.)</li>
  <li>They do <strong>not</strong> teach students what the <em>right</em> or <em>best</em> design is. They  prompt students to reflect on the human consequences of their decisions. Sometimes, students answer <em>I’m not sure I can design this well enough to prevent harm</em>. That’s a great answer too. Choosing to <em>not</em> build something is okay.</li>
</ul>
