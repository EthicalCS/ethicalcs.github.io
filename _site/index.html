<p>In Fall 2019, I redesigned our CS 1 course to integrate practice-based (coding!) reflection directly with technical concepts. This is a space to share those activities. Their goal is to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Introduce <strong>a deeper level of reflection in CS 1 courses</strong>. I want students to see that their actions either directly or indirectly impact people, communities, and cultures, and that this impact is often not felt equally by different groups of people (along lines of gender, race, class, geography, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Develop reflection habits <em>alongside</em> coding habits</strong> - all modules involve programming! I believe that habits are formed early in CS and must be tightly coupled with technical concepts in order for them to stick.</li>
  <li><strong>Pair directly with <em>existing</em> CS 1 curriculum</strong> - CS 1 is already a busy course. You don’t need to set aside a month of new material. I believe that reflection and responsible computing pairs directly with technical concepts already taught (conditionals, for loops, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>What these activies are <strong>not</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are <strong>not</strong> a replacement for teaching students issues of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3328778.3366792">cultural competency</a> and identity. While computer scientists can (and should) point to those issues in class, most of us are <em>not</em> the experts. Students should be taking courses that directly speak to the structures of power that they will be introducing systems into (including gender / race / ethnicity / class / geography / etc.)</li>
  <li>They do <strong>not</strong> teach students what the <em>correct</em> design is. They prompt students to reflect on the human consequences of their decisions. Sometimes, students answer <em>I’m not sure I can design this well enough to prevent harm</em>. That’s a great answer too. Choosing <em>not</em> to build something is okay.</li>
</ul>

<em>How does representation in a dataset impact an algorithm’s outcome? Is it possible to create a representation that treats all people fairly? What are the possible implications of facial recognition software when it is used on historically marginalized groups?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> This activity starts as a classic media manipulation lab (changing RGB values in pixels). In the last portion of the lab, students are given a series of face images, and write code to generate the <em>average</em> face of those images. In the following lecture, students reflect on what happens when we analyze the demographics of the data underlying our face-averaging algorithm. We use it as an introductory analogy to the shortcomings of training data on machine-learning, and an entry to talk about face-recognition.</li>

<em>What is ‘moral’ behavior in the context of a computer? How do we write code that is forced to assign value to people? What are the implications of our representation decisions?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Program a disaster-relief robot to prioritize which distressed people to saves. This reframing of the Trolley Problem nudges students to reflect on issues of representation in their code (what are the problems with male/female representation? Should we even represent weight?), and consider how individual decisions could amplify systemic biases if it was used at scale.</li>
