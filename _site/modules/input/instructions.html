<p>You are working for the prestigious Harwall university to meet the joint needs of <em>Admissions</em>, <em>Alumni Relations</em>, and <em>Communications</em>. People are constantly visiting campus - to see someone they know, to check out the school as a prospective, to give a talk, to interview, to come back to the school (alumni!), or for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>It would be valuable to know who is on a campus throughout the year, so you are asked to write a standard form that Harwall can give visitors to collect their information. Harwall intends to use the information from this form later on to communicate with potential donors or reach out to prospective students.</p>

<p>Since Harwall wants to make sure that this data is useful, they have also asked you to validate whatever information is entered into the form. That is your job.</p>

<h3 id="the-visitors">The Visitors</h3>
<p>Here are a couple of examples of people who may be visiting campus:</p>

<p><strong>Vignette 1:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Beverly (52) and Robert (55) Deason are bringing their daughter Mary (17) for a college visit. Mary is a junior in high school, and is thinking about Harwall because of the Engineering College. Coming from Cambridge, MA, the family is traveling across a number of colleges in Pennsylvania. Mary says that you can email her at mlp231@mac.com or text her at (617) 431-5817.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Vignette 2:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Terrell Hughes is on campus to interview for the tenure-track Computer Science faculty position. He is currently a visiting scholar at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, having been there since he got his Ph.D. from NYU a year ago. You have his business card, which lists his contact information as thughes14211@cornell.edu and 607 151 4561. Terrel laughed when you asked for his age, and just said to put down 30.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Vignette 3:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Rolf Feierabend has lived in Mifflinburg, PA since 1961, when his parents immigrated to the US, bringing then-seventeen Rolf in tow. He has been retired for a couple of years now, and takes his husky lab Winston on walks through campus on occasion. Although he has an email account feierabend411@aol.com he doesn’t really check it anymore. He says to just call him at 570-511-5161</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which information should we collect from each visitor?</li>
  <li>In the context of a form, what fields will the form have?</li>
  <li>For each field, how can you validate the input?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-code">The Code</h3>

<p>Rather than a typical online form, we’ll be designing our via the command-line in Python. You’ve been provided a template to build off of in <a href="code/validation.py">validation.py</a>. We’ll highlight the key parts here.</p>

<h4 id="the-form-function">The Form Function</h4>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">form()</code> acts as the main function of the program. It’s where we assign each of the fields that we would like to collect, and also where we report the collected information afterwards.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">form</span><span class="p">():</span>
  <span class="s">"""The form function that collects info from users"""</span>
  <span class="c"># Get street number</span>
  <span class="n">streetNum</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_street_num</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="c"># Get the age</span>
  <span class="n">age</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_age</span><span class="p">()</span>

  <span class="c"># Collect more pieces of information by writing more functions</span>

  <span class="c"># Then, print out all our collected info in a form</span>
  <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"====================="</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"We've collected the following information:"</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"- Street Number:"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">streetNum</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"- Age:"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">age</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="c"># add more</span>
  <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"====================="</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="validation-functions">Validation Functions</h4>
<p>While there are many ways to validate input in programming languages, we’ll use <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">elif</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">else</code> statements in order to practice conditional logic. For each field that you want to collect, you should have a corresponding validation function that you create. We’ve completed one for you as an example: <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_street_num()</code></p>

<p>Conceptually, <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_street_num()</code> gets input from the user and then checks a couple of basic ‘bad’ cases (you may want to check more):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the field empty?</li>
  <li>Is the field something other than an number?</li>
</ul>

<p>If the user’s input matches one of our bad cases, the function is repeated until the input passes all cases (when the code reaches the <code class="highlighter-rouge">else</code> statement below)</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_street_num</span><span class="p">():</span>
  <span class="s">""" EXAMPLE: Gets the user's street number.
  Repeats until a valid street number is given.
  Output:
  - streetNum: an integer representing the user's street number
  """</span>
  <span class="n">streetNum</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Enter the street number of your address: "</span><span class="p">)</span>

  <span class="c"># Check to see if it's empty!</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">streetNum</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">""</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"SORRY! You forgot to input your street number!</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">get_street_num</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="c"># Check to see if it's a number!</span>
  <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">streetNum</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">isdigit</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"SORRY! Your street number should be a positive number</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">get_street_num</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">streetNum</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="what-you-should-do">What you should do</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, completely the partially finished <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_age()</code> function. Provide suitable checks that someone has entered a reasonable age (for example, no one should be 800 years old).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, create new fields and new functions to validate those fields.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you are satisfied, move onto the next part of this assignment…</p>
  </li>
</ul>
